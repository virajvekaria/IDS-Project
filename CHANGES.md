# Changes Made to the Document Intelligence Search System (DISS)

## Repository Cleanup

1. **Removed Unnecessary Files**
   - Removed old script files: `1_extract_pdf.py`, `2_chunk_text.py`, `2_chunk_text_old.py`, `3_build_index.py`, `4_query_qa.py`, `4_query_qa_chat.py`
   - Removed debugging utilities: `debug_db.py`, `fix_nltk.py`
   - Removed test scripts: `test_document.py`, `test_gpu.py`, `test_index.py`, `test_small_pdf.py`

2. **Added Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README.md with installation and usage instructions
   - Added CHANGES.md to document changes made to the repository
   - Added comments to code for better readability

3. **Improved Configuration**
   - Updated config.py with better default settings
   - Increased chunk size to 1000 for better context
   - Increased chunk overlap to 200 for better context continuity
   - Set default LLM model to deepseek-r1:7b

## Code Improvements

1. **Document Processing**
   - Simplified document_processor.py to focus on PDF processing
   - Replaced pdfplumber with pypdf for better performance and fewer dependencies
   - Added better error handling and logging

2. **Initialization Process**
   - Enhanced init_documents.py to process all PDFs in the folder
   - Added logging for better visibility of the processing status
   - Added timing information for performance monitoring

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Updated requirements.txt to include only necessary dependencies
   - Added pypdf for PDF processing
   - Removed unnecessary dependencies like pdfplumber, pytesseract, etc.

4. **Run Script**
   - Enhanced run.sh to check for Ollama installation
   - Added automatic model pulling if not already available
   - Added command-line options for initialization

## Feature Enhancements

1. **GPU Acceleration**
   - Updated code to use GPU for embedding generation and inference
   - Removed multiprocessing code in favor of GPU acceleration

2. **Adaptive Similarity Thresholds**
   - Implemented adaptive similarity thresholds based on document characteristics
   - Improved retrieval quality for different types of queries

3. **Hybrid Retrieval**
   - Enabled hybrid search combining vector and keyword-based approaches
   - Improved search results for complex queries

4. **Chunk Overlap**
   - Increased chunk overlap for better context continuity
   - Improved answer generation by providing more context

## Testing

1. **Test Scripts**
   - Created test_pdf_processor.py to verify PDF processing functionality
   - Verified that the application works with all PDFs in the folder

## Deployment

1. **Run Script**
   - Enhanced run.sh for easier deployment
   - Added automatic dependency installation
   - Added automatic model pulling
